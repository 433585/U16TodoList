I used Blazor to develop this application and it is necessary to follow instructions on downloading before trying to run the .sln file in visual studio, [here is a link to a Blazor tutorial](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/aspnet/blazor-tutorial/install)

The .sln file that must be run in visual studio is located here [TodoList.sln](https://github.com/433585/U16TodoList/tree/master)
